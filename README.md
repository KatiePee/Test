I am just trying to figure out what the heck is going on, and why they heck i cant push my last project. 
So far I've went back to some old projects I've had on the master branch.
I cloned them editted them, commited, and pushed them back with no problems. I confirmed it in Github. 

So now my plan is to see if its just becasue Im using the main branch on my default, or if its just something wierd with this one respository. 

... Wish  me luck

Ok Im just putting this code in here that terminal gave me, to unstage stuff... so maybe if this does work and it is something wrong with the reop then i can try to un stage stuff...

    Changes to be committed:
        (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
